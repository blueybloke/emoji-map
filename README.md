## EmojiMap

This is a small Python Dash app I am working on as a side project. It is meant to providea neat little visualization of emoji usage on Twitter in realtime.

### Status of Project
Currently have the API connected for retrieving the data although working to get that to update in realtime. Experimenting with approaches to visualizing the data, maybe on a bubble chart or something similar.
